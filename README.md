## Problem Statement

In modern hospitals, scheduling appointments efficiently is crucial for providing quality healthcare services. The existing manual appointment scheduling processes can be time-consuming and often lead to long wait times for patients. The aim of this project is to develop a digital system that addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced technologies and artificial intelligence to:

- Identify doctor availability in real-time.
- Automate appointment slot allocation based on doctor availability and the number of waitlisted patients.
- Reduce patient waiting times and improve the overall patient experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Doctor Presence Detection**: The system uses advanced technologies such as RFID, face detection, proximity of mobile phones, or any other relevant technology to detect the presence of doctors in the hospital.

- **Artificial Intelligence-driven Slot Allocation**: Appointment slots are allocated using AI algorithms that take into account real-time doctor availability and the number of patients on the waiting list.

- **Patient-Friendly Interface**: The system provides an easy-to-use interface for both hospital staff and patients to schedule appointments efficiently.

- **Automated Notifications**: Patients receive automated notifications about their appointment details, reducing the chances of missed appointments.

- **Analytics and Reporting**: The system generates reports and analytics to help hospital administrators make data-driven decisions for resource allocation.

## Technologies Used

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI algorithms are used for appointment slot allocation and optimization.

- **RFID and Face Detection**: These technologies are employed to detect the presence of doctors in the hospital.

- **Mobile App Integration**: The system can integrate with mobile applications to detect doctor proximity.

- **Database**: A robust database system stores and manages doctor schedules, patient appointments, and historical data.

- **Web Interface**: The system provides a web-based interface for easy access and management.
